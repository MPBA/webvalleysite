       <p><strong>WebValley is the FBK summer school</strong> for dissemination of interdisciplinary research: <strong> almost 250 students</strong> (17-18y old) have attended the WebValley camps since its first edition in 2001. WebValley started as a regional initiative for high school students from Trentino Alto-Adige S&uuml;dTirol, and it is now an opportunity for national and international students to experiment scientific research.
       </p>
        </br>
        <p>
            <strong>Fellowships</strong> will include full tuition, accommodation  and travel costs. Thanks to cofounding by collaborating institutions, for the 2013 edition, 18 fellowships are available for students from: <strong>7 Trentino and AltoAdige-S&uuml;dTirol</strong>
            <strong>4 National</strong> (co-funding PLS - National Program for Mathematics and Science Education and FAST - Federation of the Scientific and Technical Associations, Italy) <strong> 7 International </strong> (co-funding: FBK Trustees Board)

        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
            <strong>The requirements</strong> to participate are: High School student (for Italy: 4th year completed), adequate knowledge of English, enthusiasm in science and new technologies, above-average school records, student’s motivation and teacher’s recommendation letters.

                <strong>The 2013 project:</strong> <strong>3D nanoWebGIS interface and complex networks for molecular medicine data</strong>. The aim of WebValley 2013 is designing a novel web tool for studying change in cells (e.g. in morphogenesis or in disease) from different points of view and in interdisciplinary teams. We aim to extend the nanoWebGIS system for shared studies on bioimages with an interface for 3D spatial structure investigation and a whole new module for complex networks analysis. The project shall integrate mathematical and biological aspects, with the opportunity of working on original data from collaborating international labs. Technology will be the backbone of the project: the team will combine different open source software tools and propose new ways of interacting with data on non-standard devices such as smart TV displays.

          <strong>The WebValley formula</strong>: <strong>Create a team of enthusiast and motivated high school students (18 y) tutored by researchers.</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The team accepts a challenge</strong> by a collaborating scientist from Ecology, Biology or Social Sciences and develops <strong>in three weeks</strong> a new web-based prototype for data analysis and management.
            </li>
            <li>
                Students are introduced to <strong>Open Source</strong> software solutions (scientific programming, web interfaces, database, GIS and data analysis); they discuss, design and develop the new system interacting with scientists. They learn to select tools, organize their own workplan, and respond with a new solution to a problem of ethical interest. A working prototype web solution and technical results are presented at the end of the three week period.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The project activities are developed mostly in teamwork</strong> as in a true research environment, that is informal and of high quality in resources, competence and organization. Each student can differently contribute to project with ideas, software code or data preparation, design of new web interfaces, project presentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The location:</strong> the school is held in <strong>a high-tech lab located in a small Alpine village</strong>, to demonstrate that web access may support new types of innovative actions also in remote areas, combining new technologies and high-quality of life in a natural environment.(<strong>Lab is open all day</strong>, but group activities and leisure time are also part of the three weeks).
            </li>
